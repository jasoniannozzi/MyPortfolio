                <h3>Rank: Sergeant </br>MOS: 25B/Information Technology Specialist</h3>
                <h3>February 2019-Present</h3>
                <p>I joined the United States Army in February 2019 as a member of the New York National Guard and attended Basic Training at Fort Benning, home of
                    the
                    Infantry. Upon graduation of Basic Combat Training I shipped out to Fort Gordon, GA home of the
                    Army's
                    Cyber Center of Excellence. It was there that I trained in Cisco networking systems (CCNA) and
                    network security fundamentals. During my time at Fort Gordon I received an Army Achievement Medal
                    for
                    being named Distinguished Graduate by obtaining the highest GPA in my class. I transitioned from the National Guard to the Regular (Active Duty) Army in July 2020 and 
                    I am currently stationed in Fort Campbell, Kentucky as a member of the 101st Airborne Division. My role as a team leader allows me to supply support and guidance to junior level Soldiers in my platoon while aiding senior level staff in daily operations. 
                    I am looking to build off my experience in the military and pursue new and exciting opportunities upon the completion of my military service in the summer of 2023.</p>

                <h1>New York City Department of Corrections</h1>
                <img src="img/DOCWhitelogo.jpeg" class="workicon" alt="doclogo" />
                <h3>Correction Officer</h3>
                <h3>January 2016-March 2020</h3>
                <p>I became a New York City Correction Officer after following a desire to pursue a career in civil
                    service.
                    While working for the department I was assigned to work at various sites on New York City's infamous
                    jail complex, Rikers Island. While assigned to Rikers Island I worked at the Eric M. Taylor Center
                    (EMTC) and the George R. Vierno Center (GRVC). My steady post was the facility's intake area
                    commonly
                    called "the receiving room" and I was responsible for processing all inmates entering and exiting
                    the
                    facility. I would review legal paperwork such as securing orders, sentence and commitment forms,
                    along
                    with various other court documents prior to accepting or discharging a person in our custody. These
                    responsibilities were in addition to being a first responder to all facility alarms that may occur
                    during my tour. I ultimately made the decision to leave my career as a Correction Officer to go back to school
                    and pursue a position in the Information Technology field while focusing more on my Army career.</p>

                <h3>Senior Client Service Associate</h3>
                <h3>June 2013-January 2016</h3>
                <p>Prior to pursuing a career in public service I was in the private sector working in the financial
                    services industry. I joined First Republic Bank in June, 2013 as a Personal Banker but shifted over
                    to
                    the Client Services Team as my focus transitioned to banking operations. My responsibilities included
                    assisting the
                    private wealth management team by acting as a main point of contact for bank clients. I would assist
                    with a variety of financial transactions such as the
                    opening and closing of bank accounts, withdrawals, deposits, funds transfers, wire transfers,
                    cashierâ€™s checks, and debit card inquiries. I was also responsible for daily operational
                    tasks such as providing quality assurance to the client service group by assisting with audits to
                    ensure
                    proper policy and procedure was adhered to. I also assisted with the onboarding and training of new
                    employees through one-on-one and group sessions.
