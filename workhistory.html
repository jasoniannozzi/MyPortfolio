            <h3>Rank: Specialist </br>MOS: 25B/Information Technology Specialist</h3>
            <h3>February 2019-Present</h3>
            <p>I joined the United States Army in February 2019 and attended Basic Training at Fort Benning, home of the
                Infantry. Upon graduation of Basic Combat Training I shipped out to Fort Gordon, GA home of the Army's
                Cyber Center of Excellence. It was there that I trained in Cisco networking systems (CCNA) and
                network security fundamentals. During my time at Fort Gordon I received an Army Achievement Medal for
                being named Distinguished Graduate by achieving the highest GPA in my class. At this current time, I am
                enrolled in front-end and full-stack web development courses through General Assembly and Wagner
                College, respectively, while working full-time with the New York National Guard.</p>

            <h1>New York City Department of Corrections</h1>

            <h3>Correction Officer</h3>
            <h3>January 2016-March 2020</h3>
            <p>I became a New York City Correction Officer after following a desire to pursue a career in civil service.
                While working for the department I was assigned to work at various sites on New York City's infamous
                jail complex, Rikers Island. While assigned to Rikers Island I worked at the Eric M. Taylor Center
                (EMTC) and the George R. Vierno Center (GRVC). My steady post was the facility's intake area commonly
                called "the receiving room" and I was responsible for processing all inmates entering and exiting the
                facility. I would review legal paperwork such as securing orders, sentence and commitment forms, along
                with various other court documents prior to accepting or discharging a person in our custody. These
                responsibilities were in addition to being a first responder to all facility alarms that may occur
                during my tour. I ultimately choose to leave my career as a Correction Officer to go back to school
                and pursue a position in the Information Technology field while focusing more on my Army career.</p>

            <h3>Senior Client Service Associate</h3>
            <h3>June 2013-January 2016</h3>
            <p>Prior to pursuing a career in public service I was in the private sector working in the financial
                services industry. I joined First Republic Bank in June, 2013 as a Personal Banker but shifted over to
                the Client Services Team as I began to focus on banking operations. My responsibilities included assisting the
                private wealth management team by acting as a main point of contact for bank clients. I would assist with a variety of financial transactions such as the
                opening and closing of bank accounts, withdrawals, deposits, funds transfers, wire transfers, cashierâ€™s checks, and debit card inquiries. I was also responsible for daily operational
                tasks such as providing quality assurance to the client service group by assisting with audits to ensure
                proper policy and procedure was adhered to. I also assisted with the onboarding and training of new
                employees through one-on-one and group sessions.
